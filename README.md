# K-R_practice
My implementations of tasks and interpretations of functions from K&amp;R book (2nd edition).

This is an educational project, which have a purpose to consolidate previously acquired knowledge in C programing language.
This repo may be useful to developers learning C language, as I will try to highlight all of mistakes I made while studying K&R book and add nessesary comments in code.
I'll try to describe in detail any non-obvious moments from the book in comments.

My toolchain is: 

  Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
  
  x86-64
  
  VS Code 1.88.1
  
  gcc 11.4.0 (or 12)
  
  gcc -std=c99
